The jar files in this directory are required for the <svn> task to work. They can be found as part of the svnant 
download from subclipse.tigris.org at 
http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?collapseFolder=1731&folderID=1731

The reason these jar file are necessary is because the build.xml file in this directory will automatically pull 
code analysis tools from SVN when needed. This allows a single project to control this different kinds of code 
analysis that we want to implement. It also simplifies the build.xml file somewhat, removing tasks that would be 
repeated in each of our projects.
